// Extends the agent.ts and implement AI-specific logic. 
// It's where you would integrate your machine learning models, 
// Monte Carlo simulations, or any other advanced decision-making algorithms. 
// This would be where your "Highly adaptive AI opponents" would be implemented.

// AI logic here, perhaps using trained reinforcement learning models inspired by Pluribus.
